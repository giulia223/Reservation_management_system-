# Reservation_management_system
A reservation management system designed for a travel agency.

## Project Description
This project models a comprehensive travel agency management system. The local database is designed to handle the administration of the agency and its agents, clients who book travel packages, and the details of the packages themselves. It covers components such as flights, accommodations, client reviews, payments, and transfers.
The system provides a structured way to:
- Track reservations and manage booking histories
- Store and retrieve accommodation and transfer details
- Process and monitor payment information
- Associate clients with their selected travel packages
