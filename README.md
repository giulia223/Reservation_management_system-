# Reservation_management_system
A reservation management system designed for a travel agency.

## Project Description
This project models a comprehensive travel agency management system. The local database is designed to handle the administration of the agency and its agents, clients who book travel packages, and the details of the packages themselves. It covers components such as flights, accommodations, client reviews, payments, and transfers.
The system provides a structured way to:
- Track reservations and manage booking histories
- Store and retrieve accommodation and transfer details
- Process and monitor payment information
- Associate clients with their selected travel packages
- Collect feedback through client review tracking

## Model Utility
- Agency and Agent Management: Enables the agency to manage its agents, who are responsible for selling travel packages.
- Client and Booking Management: Allows the agency to track clients who make reservations and associate those bookings with specific agents.
- Travel Package Management: Facilitates the agency in offering travel packages that include transport and accommodation.
- Reviews and Feedback: Enables clients to submit reviews for services used (flights, accommodation, etc.), which the agency can analyze for quality and improvement.
- Payments and Transfers: Supports the handling of payments for confirmed bookings and tracks transfers between different locations.
